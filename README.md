##Description
The fourth week of school focused on creating objects out of constructors. This website used constructor functions to place a pizza order based on a single crust and topping choice. 
##Setup
######Open the index.html file in your browser bar and proceed from there. Currently that is the only way it can be viewed, but when I have it up and running you'll be able to reach it via vrdlc.github.io, my temporary portfolio site. 



#Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Javascript
